Problem

Given an array nums of n integers,
are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0?
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:
The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]

A solution set is:
{ 
    (-1, 0, 1),
    (-1,-1, 2)
}

Solution:
Combination 3 items and if sum of 3 items is zero, add 3 items to set as a tuple.

TODO
How can I combinate?
