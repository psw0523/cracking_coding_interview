Problem
Asked by Google.

You are given a list of rectangles representing by min and max x- and y- coordinates.
Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other.
If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

For example, given the following rectangles:
    (1,4)  (3,3)
    (-1,3) (2,1)
    (0,5)  (4,3)

return true as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.
