Problem
Asked by Google.

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues.
It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right
such that three operations are possible:
    - push(x) : add a new item x to the left end of the list
    - pop(x)  : remove and return the item on the left end of the list
    - pull(x) : remove the item on the right end of the list

Implement a quack using three stacks and O(1) additional memory, so that
the armotized time for any push,pop, or pull operation is O(1).
